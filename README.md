# Trust Identifier Trace

A robust toolkit for identifier normalization, challenge logic, and artifact creation related to trust records (LexisNexis, GLEIF, and more) specifically tied to Travis Steven Ryle and related estate/trust entities.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Trust Identifier Trace provides secure, auditable normalization and analysis of trust-related records. It asserts authorship, monitors identifier usage, and generates overlays and challenge artifacts for compliance and transparency.

### Key Features

- **Identifier Normalization:** Standardizes and validates records (LexID, Case Numbers, PINs).
- **Bot Logic:** Flags unauthorized use, deploys overlays, and supports §609/§604 challenges.
- **Challenge Automation:** Targets key entities, automates artifact creation, and logs all actions.
- **Offline Mode:** Handles network failures gracefully and provides fallback sample data.
- **Audit Artifacts:** Commits timestamped overlays and scan results.
- **Dashboards:** Real-time analytics and multi-run scan aggregation.
